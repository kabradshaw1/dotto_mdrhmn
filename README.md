# React Django and PostgreSQL server

## Purpose
This project is for the purpose of learning about integrating these three technolgies: Django, PostgreSQL, and React.  It will also use Django Restframework and axios.

## Installation

* Install python 3, PostgreSQL, and Node.js from their sites and set them up.  Node isn't actually used to run anything, so it's not required.  I just used it to download the front end packages.
* Create a directory for this project and cd into that directory in the command line.  This folder directory will only hold the project and invironment files.
* Create a virtual environment for the project by typing, python -m venv project_env, into the command line
* login to the virtual environment by typing, project_env\Scripts\activate, into the command line (windows only)
* Install python packages: pip install Django djangorestframework django-cors-headers dj-database-url django-heroku gunicorn whitenoise python-dotenv psycopg2 psycopg2-binary
